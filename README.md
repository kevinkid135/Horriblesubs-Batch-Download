# Horriblesubs-Batch-Download
This python script allows you to click all the episodes of an anime. This way, you don't need to wait for them to release a btch file.

## How to
### Set-up
You'll need to download python 2.7.x (this is the version I used, but could possibly work with newer ones as well)
You may find python at https://www.python.org

You'll also need to download selenium. This is normally used to debug web apps, but essentially it's a scripting library.
More information on how to found here:
http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#downloading-python-bindings-for-selenium

Lastly (which is also included in the previous step), you'll need to download a chrome driver. If you're tech savvy enough, you may modify this code to work with other drivers. Knowing the location of the driver is important.
The download can be found here: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
(also found on the selenium site)

### Customizing the script
I've commented what needs to be changed (comments are written with "#" without the quotes).
Change the global variables to point to the appriopate location of things.

## Running the script
Open the script using the Python IDLE (if you have python properly installed, you can right click and press open with Python IDLE)
on the top, click run, then click run module
